### Context:
I have worked on this project for 9-10 hours. This has been my first time integrating HTML & CSS coding to structure/style the application so most of my time was worked on styling and flexboxes.

### Learning Goals:
Most of the learning goals were understanding CSS flexbox along with understanding the HTML structure with how different tags interact. HTML/CSS/JS were used to create the application. 

### Wins + Challenges:
One big win is not spending time debugging the functionality of the application. Another win was using the hidden class to achieve easy functionality. Some of the challenges I faced were mostly with understanding the difference between block vs inline tags, and setting up my flexbox containers. With the use of chrome dev tools, it was very helpful in manipulating the border/padding/margin and seeing the changes happening on-screen.
