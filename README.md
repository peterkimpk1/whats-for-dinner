### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
This application allows the user to generate a random meal type of their choice (Side, Main, Dessert, or Entire Meal), and also allows the user to create their own recipe to add to the recipe collection.
### Installation Instructions:

2. Clone it to your local machine
3. Access the app by using your text editor of choice and opening index.html

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
I have worked on this project for 9-10 hours. This has been my first time integrating HTML & CSS coding to structure/style the application so most of my time was worked on styling and flexboxes. I'm 3 weeks into Mod 1 Turing Program.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
Most of the learning goals were understanding CSS flexbox along with understanding the HTML structure with how different tags interact. HTML/CSS/JS were used to create the application. 
### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
One big win is not spending time debugging the functionality of the application. Another win was using the hidden class to achieve easy functionality.Some of the challenges I faced were mostly with understanding the difference between block vs inline tags, and setting up my flexbox containers. With the use of chrome dev tools, it was very helpful in manipulating the border/padding/margin and seeing the changes happening on-screen.
